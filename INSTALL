Installation instructions:

REQUIRED PACKAGES:
 This code requires a recent version of python, with the numpy package
  installed.  See for details:
     http://www.python.org/
     http://numpy.scipy.org/
  It has been tested on python v2.6 with numpy v1.4

 For fast linear algebra operations, this package relies on the open-source
  packages BLAS, LAPACK, and ARPACK.  For details on installing these,
  see
    http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
    http://www.netlib.org/blas/
    http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/
  if python+numpy is installed on your system, you may already have a
  working BLAS and LAPACK installation. 

INSTALLATION
 First the setup.py file must be modified to fit your system.  
  Open pyLLE/setup.py and edit LIBS to point to the directory where your
  BLAS, LAPACK, and ARPACK libraries are (these should look like, e.g.
  libarpack.a)
 
 Once this is squared away, you can run

      python setup.py build
      python setup.py install


DOCUMENTATION
 The python routines have a fairly complete set of documentation.  For
  help, you can run the python interpreter, and type, e.g.
   >> from pyLLE import LLE
   >> help(LLE)
   >> help(LLE.LLE)
  this provides information on inputs and outputs for the individual routines
