Installation instructions:

REQUIRED PACKAGES:
 This code requires a recent version of python, with the numpy package
  installed.  See for details:
     http://www.python.org/
     http://numpy.scipy.org/
  It has been tested on python v2.6 with numpy v1.4

 For fast linear algebra operations, this package relies on the open-source
  packages BLAS, LAPACK, and ARPACK.  For details on installing these,
  see
    http://www.netlib.org/lapack/
    http://www.netlib.org/blas/
    http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/
  if python+numpy is installed on your system, you may already have a
  working BLAS and LAPACK installation. 

INSTALLATION
 First the setup.py file must be modified to fit your system.  Open the
  file with a text editor, and modify the library_dirs list to point to
  the locations of your BLAS, LAPACK, and ARPACK libraries.  Optionally,
  you may also specify extra compile and link arguments for your system.
 
 The setup file is configured for an in-place installation.  To compile 
  and run the code, type at the command prompt

      python setup.py build_ext --inplace

 This will create a shared-object library _LLE.so and a python 
  executable named LLE.py.  To test this, run
     
      python test.py
 
 This is not an exhaustive test - it merely runs a simple example to 
  make sure the code has been installed correctly.

DOCUMENTATION
 The python routines have a fairly complete set of documentation.  For
  help, you can run the python interpreter, and type, e.g.
   >> import LLE
   >> help(LLE)
   >> help(LLE.LLE)
  this provides information on inputs and outputs for the individual routines
